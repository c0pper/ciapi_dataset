"First and foremost, patriotism is a polytheism in Allah the Almighty: Patriotism is a deceptive religion. And a careless approach that requires the homeland worships a heathen and a ruler without God. It forces individuals to work solely for it, and be willing to make sacrifices and fight for it. And expending hatred and naivety on everyone who is outside its borders, even if they are God's protectors. And investing love and loyalty to everyone within its boundaries, and that they were among the worst infidels and the most insidious of polytheists. \""There are still some who take others as Allah's equal - they love them as they should love Allah - but sincere believers adore Allah even more\"", the Imam stated. Patriotism disregards domestic and foreign laws: the national bond reigns supreme. On the topic of who it is required to combine judgements on people\"", Sharia says that the house of disbelief, headed by unbelief's rules, is distinct from the house of Islam, which is followed by Islamic provisions and administers what Allah has revealed. The love of one's country is one sort of transgression, the destructive notion of \""patriotism\"" that has arisen among Muslim sons.

These coordinated invasions have intensified and it was repeated, especially after the proclamation that the infidels will destroy the Islamic state. One of the outcomes of these coordinated assaults is that the Islamic State indicates to all sons of Islam that the path of jihad is open to them, everyone according to his ability and willingness. And the caliphate's blessing is that jihad is now available to all Muslims everywhere, without regard for limits or diameters. And the benefits of these united invasions expand Mujahideen activities on the ground to areas hitherto unexplored. Among them is the attrition of enemy forces and armies as a result of its incapacity to deal with these simultaneous strikes. The Islamic State's cohesiveness has been a phenomenon.

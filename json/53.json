{"RESPONSE":{"DOCUMENT":"This edict will remain in effect until they adopt Islamic law, by entering into it or surrendering to it through a Dharma contract, armistice treaty, or security. It is ruled by tyrants who rule over Muslims' necks. For two key reasons: These tyrants were particularly interested in satisfying the Crusader states by defending their subjects. And make the country available to them for tourism and investment. And demonstrate their abilities to fight the mujahedeen and prevent them from harming these tails; on the one hand, the continual influx of Crusader citizens into their countries implies that the funds are checked into vaults through tourism earnings, fees and taxes, customs, and economic investment returns ... other financial resources that expand as the volume of \\\"foreigners\\\" scrutinized on the territory of these countries grows. That is why we discover that some of these tyrants have turned their conquered country into a magnet for \\\"Foreign\\\" investors, even taking control of the economy as if they were Stakeholders in the country.\n","CATEGORIZATION":[{"FEATURE":"INTELLIGENCE","DOMAIN":[{"FREQUENCY":33.18,"SCORE":7770,"NAME":"/Intelligence

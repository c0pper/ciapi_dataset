{"RESPONSE":{"DOCUMENT":"Is it possible that not everyone is aware that the House of Jerusalem will only be opened once? Politicians are slaves in the hands of tyrants and their minions. Their projects alter according to what their employers dictate, but what is constant for them is their hatred of Islam and Muslims, as well as their battle against the monotheistic servants of God! Because God loves the men of the Islamic state, they exposed their flaws and lies, showing the public their labor and infidelity, and that they are puppets controlled by the Crusaders and Jews. We recommend you, and we stress on you, and we ask you by God the Almighty not to eat, and do not grow tired of relentlessly deconstructing the families of your brothers and sisters wherever they were! And not a day goes by without you plotting and preparing to release their family, either with weapons or by virtue, do not despair and spare no effort to begin and deprive them of He wounds them and assaults them in their homes, so they let him go. To those who have been away from the battlefield of jihad for a while: the people of suffering and hardship from every cost of war. Who, with their fortunate operations, made Europe dizzy, as well as America and many Crusader countries, and stopped them on one leg in constant alert! There is a trace of a mujahedeen hero there for the infidels.\n","CATEGORIZATION":[{"FEATURE":"INTELLIGENCE","DOMAIN":[{"FREQUENCY":10.76,"SCORE":2145,"NAME":"/Intelligence Taxonomy/Politics","RULE":[{"SCORE":1335,"END":94,"BEGIN":0,"OPERAND":{"END":55,"BEGIN":51}},{"SCORE":810,"END":160,"BEGIN":96,"OPERAND":{"END":141,"BEGIN":135}}]},{"FREQUENCY":8.13,"SCORE":1620,"NAME":"/Intelligence Taxonomy/Politics/Espionage and Intelligence/Conspiracy","RULE":[{"SCORE":810,"END":160,"BEGIN":96,"OPERAND":{"END":106,"BEGIN":96}},{"SCORE":810,"END":1003,"BEGIN":756,"OPERAND":{"END":797,"BEGIN":790}}]},{"FREQUENCY":7.63,"SCORE":1520,"NAME":"/Intelligence Taxonomy/Religion and Belief/Islam","RULE":[{"SCORE":480,"END":358,"BEGIN":162,"OPERAND":{"END":279,"BEGIN":275}},{"SCORE":390,"END":358,"BEGIN":162,"OPERAND":{"END":291,"BEGIN":285}},{"SCORE":650,"END":1135,"BEGIN":1005,"OPERAND":{"END":1061,"BEGIN":1057}}]},{"FREQUENCY":6.7,"SCORE":1335,"NAME":"/Intelligence Taxonomy/Unrest, Conflicts and War/Civil Unrest/Religious Conflict","RULE":{"SCORE":1335,"END":1135,"BEGIN":1005,"OPERAND":{"END":1061,"BEGIN":1057}}}]},{"FEATURE":"CRIME","DOMAIN":{"FREQUENCY":8.13,"SCORE":1620,"NAME":"/Crime Taxonomy/Terrorism","RULE":[{"SCORE":810,"END":1135,"BEGIN":1005,"OPERAND":{"END":1061,"BEGIN":1057}},{"SCORE":810,"END":1349,"BEGIN":1289,"OPERAND":{"END":1320,"BEGIN":1311}}]}},{"FEATURE":"TERRORISM","DOMAIN":{"FREQUENCY":6.7,"SCORE":1335,"NAME":"/Terrorism Taxonomy/Terrorism by matrix/Religiously inspired terrorism","RULE":{"SCORE":1335,"END":1349,"BEGIN":1289,"OPERAND":{"END":1320,"BEGIN":1311}}}},{"FEATURE":"GEOGRAPHY","DOMAIN":{"FREQUENCY":0.14,"SCORE":13,"NAME":"/Geo Taxonomy/Israel","RULE":[{"SCORE":10,"END":94,"BEGIN":0,"OPERAND":{"END":68,"BEGIN":60}},{"SCORE":3,"END":94,"BEGIN":0,"OPERAND":{"END":68,"BEGIN":60}}]}},{"FEATURE":"CYBERCRIME","DOMAIN":[]},{"FEATURE":"EMOTIONS","DOMAIN":[{"FREQUENCY":0.05,"SCORE":10,"NAME":"/Emotions Taxonomy/Suffering","RULE":{"SCORE":10,"END":1135,"BEGIN":1005,"OPERAND":{"END":1098,"BEGIN":1090}}},{"FREQUENCY":0.05,"SCORE":10,"NAME":"/Emotions Taxonomy/Hatred","RULE":{"SCORE":10,"END":358,"BEGIN":162,"OPERAND":{"END":270,"BEGIN":265}}}]}],"PEOPLE":{"FEATURE":"LIST","PERSON":[]},"ORGANIZATIONS":{"FEATURE":"LIST","ORGANIZATION":[]},"PLACES":{"FEATURE":"LIST","PLACE":[{"BASE":"Jerusalem","TRACKS":{"TRACK":{"BEGIN":60,"END":68}},"FEATURE":"FULLNAME","FIELD":[{"BASE":1,"NAME":"ID"},{"BASE":281184,"NAME":"GeonamesId"}],"SYNCON":{"GLOSS":"city in Palestine (Jerusalem District/Israel/Asia)"},"LINKED_SYNCONS":{"COUNT":1,"LINKED_SYNCON":{"NAME":"Is a","SYNCON":{"TYPE":"Noun","LEMMA":{"TEXT":"city"}}}},"PROP":[{"REGION":"Palestine - Jerusalem District"},{"COUNTRY":"Israel"},{"CONTINENT":"Asia"},{"COORD":"31.783054/35.216667"}],"SENTIMENT":{"OVERALL":0.6}},{"BASE":"America","TRACKS":{"TRACK":{"BEGIN":1205,"END":1211}},"FEATURE":"FULLNAME","FIELD":[{"BASE":2,"NAME":"ID"},{"BASE":10861432,"NAME":"GeonamesId"}],"SYNCON":{"GLOSS":"area"},"LINKED_SYNCONS":{"COUNT":1,"LINKED_SYNCON":{"NAME":"Is a","SYNCON":{"TYPE":"Noun","LEMMA":{"TEXT":"area"}}}},"PROP":{"COORD":"19.0/-96.0"}},{"BASE":"Europe","TRACKS":{"TRACK":{"BEGIN":1180,"END":1185}},"FEATURE":"FULLNAME","FIELD":[{"BASE":3,"NAME":"ID"},{"BASE":6255148,"NAME":"GeonamesId"}],"SYNCON":{"GLOSS":"continent"},"LINKED_SYNCONS":{"COUNT":1,"LINKED_SYNCON":{"NAME":"Is a","SYNCON":{"TYPE":"Noun","LEMMA":{"TEXT":"continent"}}}},"PROP":{"COORD":"46.0/7.0"},"SENTIMENT":{"OVERALL":-3}}]},"TEXTMINING":[{"FEATURE":"DOM_SPECIFIC","ENTITY":[{"BASE":"battle","TRACKS":{"TRACK":{"BEGIN":311,"END":316}},"TYPE":"Military Actions","GLOSS":"A  battle  is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces.

{"RESPONSE":{"DOCUMENT":"With its new system, it is kicking off the instructional process. Following God's assistance in overcoming the most significant problems in the face of commencing the educational process in line with God's law in Islam House. The most significant of them are educational curricula, the construction of an educational system, and the preparation and qualification of teachers to meet the educational process's objectives. To address additional difficulties, such as publishing and disseminating curricula, educational centers have developed States on a day to begin the instructional process in their schools. The Center worked in cooperation with the Services Bureau to rehabilitate schools that need to qualify. Many of its facilities have been renovated. Many roads leading to schools and many names have been changed, particularly those of similar national or national significance with names related with the Islamic nation's heritage (Umma). For example, \\\"Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum\\\" school was recalled as the \\\"Al-taleea\\\" school, while the school (Al-Naqqaba) was known as the (The Revolutionaries) School. And the school (Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak), whose name was Abd al-Wahab al-Shawaf. Fifty-three schools changed their names as the number of schools increased. The center also worked on the completion of the separation of males and females. Launching studies at universities was just as important a challenge as Fatah's. schools. The Diwan has restructured the faculties and organized education. So the colleges were divided into Sharia, medical, engineering and exchange science groups. As for the medical group, it collected All its colleges, institutes and preparatory schools under the name (University of Medical Sciences); There were some colleges that teach subjects that are contrary to Islamic law, as the faculties of fine arts, law and the like. Males and females were allowed to enroll to all open colleges equally, with the exception of some sections it does enter only males - as engineering branches - and departments that only females enter, such as midwifery and obstetrics, newly established.\n","CATEGORIZATION":[{"FEATURE":"INTELLIGENCE","DOMAIN":[{"FREQUENCY":12.29,"SCORE":2320,"NAME":"/Intelligence
